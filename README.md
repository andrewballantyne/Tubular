## Features

* Connection and pulling data from YouTube
* Able to login to a given user's account (through a youtube standard login screen)
* Shows all playlists and subscriptions
* A list of new items, aka videos, since the last pull
    * Sort/Filter the list
    * Showcase counts of what pages have what videos
    * Interact functionality for each item
        * Add to new playlist
        * Watch for more updates (by name partial or more from channel)

The general goal is to make a better UI to navigate and use YouTube (for channels and videos your account would already be aware of).
Initial goals have no intention of making it possible to search and find new channels and videos related or unrelated to stuff appearing 
on this site.
